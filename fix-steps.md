# Steps to Fix Project Issues

## 1. Directory Structure Issue

- We have a nested directory structure: `/Users/ben/momwp/momwp`
- This happened because we created the project in a subdirectory with the same name
- We should work with the inner directory which has the proper Next.js setup

## 2. Missing TypeScript Types

- We need to ensure that all types are properly defined in our components
- The main issues were in `DataRecord` and handling errors

## 3. Missing Components

- We needed to create various components:
  - `DatasetSearch`
  - `DatasetViewer`
  - `DataTable`
  - `DataChart`

## 4. API Implementation

- We created an API client to connect to data.gov.sg
- Need to make sure all API endpoints are properly typed

## 5. Dependency Installation

- We installed all the necessary dependencies:
  - axios (for API requests)
  - recharts (for data visualization)
  - @tanstack/react-table (for tabular data)
  - zustand (for state management)
  - shadcn/ui (for UI components)

## 6. State Management

- We implemented a store using Zustand to manage the application state
- This store handles fetching datasets, selecting datasets, and searching within datasets

## Next Steps

1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
2. Test the application by searching for datasets and visualizing data
3. Fix any remaining TypeScript or runtime errors
4. Deploy to Vercel
